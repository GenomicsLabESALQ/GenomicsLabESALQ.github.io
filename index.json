Despite advances in smut genomics, the relationships between fungal genetic diversity, host adaptation, and virulence remain elusive.\nMethods We applied chromosome-level genome sequencing (Oxford Nanopore and Illumina technologies) of two haploid strains (MAT-1 x MAT-2) per isolate and high-depth transcriptomic profiling (Illumina) during early infection (48 hpi) of a more virulent isolate (SSC04) in resistant (SP80-3280) and susceptible (IAC66-6) sugarcane genotypes.\nResults Despite the overall genomic similarity (99.9%), we identified nine highly polymorphic genomic islands (HPIs). The most variant HPI harbors the mating-type loci, where dense sequence variation, intrachromosomal rearrangements, and inversions, potentially linked to transposable element remnants, were observed. Additionally, the genome-wide analysis revealed non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 160 genes, including those involved in vesicular trafficking and candidate-secreted effectors. Transcriptomic profiling of the more virulent isolated revealed host-dependent transcriptional reprogramming in response to immune and metabolic cues, driving distinct infection strategies: in resistant plants, the fungus upregulated genes associated with detoxification, nitrogen starvation responses, and cell wall-degrading enzymes, while in susceptible hosts, it induced genes related to hyphal growth, lipid catabolism, and the unfolded protein response. The repertoire of expressed candidate effector genes also varied according to host and isolate genotypes.\nConclusions These findings uncover genomic signatures and context-dependent transcriptional regulation shaping the adaptive landscape of S. scitamineum virulence, identifying targets for pathogen monitoring and breeding for resistance.","tags":["article"],"title":"Chromosome-level comparative genomics and host-specific fungal transcriptomics uncover adaptive virulence strategies in the sugarcane smut pathogen","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro Marcus de Souza Confort","Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello"],"categories":null,"content":"New preprint from our group now available on bioRxiv! Check out the abstract in this post.\nOur group has just published a preprint on August 30th presenting novel results on the transcriptional responses of two sugarcane varieties to infection by the nematode Pratylenchus zeae. The work is now available on bioRxiv!\nAbstract:\nThe root-lesion nematode Pratylenchus zeae ranks among the most pervasive soilborne threats to global sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) production, however, the molecular basis of host resistance to this pathogen remains largely unexplored. Using comparative transcriptomics 15 days after inoculation, we profiled root response patterns of a resistant cultivar (RB966982) and a susceptible cultivar (CTC9001). Differential gene expression analysis identified 3,385 DEGs (1,426 up, 1,959 down) in the susceptible CTC9001 and 8,689 DEGs (5,334 up, 3,355 down) in the resistant RB966982 when comparing control and inoculated plants, revealing distinct genotype-specific defense strategies. The resistant genotype mounted a coordinated, multilayered defense marked by dramatic transcriptional reprogramming, including intensified glycolysis and fatty-acid biosynthesis, elevated oxidoreductase/ROS activity, and concurrent activation of jasmonic and salicylic acid associated pathways, with strong induction of multiple PR1 homologs. RB966982 also showed pre-primed and inducible resistance gene analogs and targeted cell-wall reinforcement through xyloglucan fucosylation. By contrast, CTC9001 displayed a delayed or attenuated response characterized by cell-proliferation signatures and broad activation of callose-related defenses (1,3-β-D-glucan synthesis) that appear insufficient to limit nematode progression. GO enrichment analysis revealed that the resistant response was dominated by biological processes linked to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, oxidoreductase activity, hormone signaling, and cell-wall organization, while the susceptible response was enriched in stress-related pathways lacking coordinated metabolic and structural reinforcement. Collectively, these findings indicate that durable resistance to P. zeae is unlikely to arise from a single mechanism, effective protection will require stacking complementary defense layers, including early metabolic reprogramming, robust hormone-mediated signaling, and reinforced cell-wall barriers.

Using comparative transcriptomics 15 days after inoculation, we profiled root response patterns of a resistant cultivar (RB966982) and a susceptible cultivar (CTC9001). Differential gene expression analysis identified 3,385 DEGs (1,426 up, 1,959 down) in the susceptible CTC9001 and 8,689 DEGs (5,334 up, 3,355 down) in the resistant RB966982 when comparing control and inoculated plants, revealing distinct genotype-specific defense strategies. The resistant genotype mounted a coordinated, multilayered defense marked by dramatic transcriptional reprogramming, including intensified glycolysis and fatty-acid biosynthesis, elevated oxidoreductase/ROS activity, and concurrent activation of jasmonic and salicylic acid associated pathways, with strong induction of multiple PR1 homologs. RB966982 also showed pre-primed and inducible resistance gene analogs and targeted cell-wall reinforcement through xyloglucan fucosylation. By contrast, CTC9001 displayed a delayed or attenuated response characterized by cell-proliferation signatures and broad activation of callose-related defenses (1,3-β-D-glucan synthesis) that appear insufficient to limit nematode progression. GO enrichment analysis revealed that the resistant response was dominated by biological processes linked to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, oxidoreductase activity, hormone signaling, and cell-wall organization, while the susceptible response was enriched in stress-related pathways lacking coordinated metabolic and structural reinforcement. Collectively, these findings indicate that durable resistance to             P. zeae             is unlikely to arise from a single mechanism, effective protection will require stacking complementary defense layers, including early metabolic reprogramming, robust hormone-mediated signaling, and reinforced cell-wall barriers. The candidate RGAs, PR1 homologs, and cell-wall remodeling enzymes identified here, together with the GO-enriched pathways, provide concrete targets for marker-assisted breeding and gene editing strategies aimed at developing sugarcane cultivars with durable nematode resistance.","tags":["article"],"title":"Multilayered Defense Responses in Sugarcane Against Pratylenchus zeae Revealed by Comparative Transcriptomics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gustavo Husein","Castro-Moretti, Fernanda R.","Prado, Melina","Amorim, Lilian","Mazzafera, Paulo","Canales, Javier","Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1751932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1751932800,"objectID":"aa0b2949fe3987357997ebc777949f84","permalink":"https://genomicslabesalq.github.io/publication/husein_2025_1/","publishdate":"2025-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/husein_2025_1/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract                        Asian soybean rust (ASR), caused by             Phakopsora pachyrhizi             , represents a major constraint to soybean cultivation, with yield losses approaching 90% in the absence of effective control strategies. When coupled with the increasing incidence of drought driven by climate change, the co-occurrence of these biotic and abiotic pressures imposes a complex challenge for crop resilience. In this study, we explored the molecular responses of soybean (             Glycine max             ) to concurrent water limitation and ASR infection through an integrative analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets. To capture both linear and conditional relationships among molecular features, we employed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) alongside Copula Graphical Models (CGMs). WGCNA identified 17 gene co-expression modules exhibiting significant correlations with 27 annotated metabolites. Among these, abscisic acid showed consistent associations with drought-responsive modules enriched in central metabolic pathways and transcription factors such as Dof and bHLH. In contrast, modules linked to fungal infection were correlated with dipeptides and D-galacturonic acid, implicating early defense signaling and cell wall remodeling. The CGM framework further revealed sparse, condition-specific networks of differentially expressed genes and metabolites directly associated with each stressor, including genes encoding a dirigent-like protein, pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, and a nucleoredoxin, as well as metabolites such as inosine, Epi-dihydrophaseic acid and 2-oxoadipic acid. Notably, no gene or metabolite was found to be directly responsive to both stresses, underscoring the modular and stress-specific architecture of soybean defense. Together, these results highlight a hierarchical regulatory structure and demonstrate the value of combining correlation-based and dependency-driven models to identify candidate targets for multi-stress resilience breeding.","tags":["article"],"title":"Integrative Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals Stress-Specific Molecular Architectures in Soybean under Drought and Rust Infection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Taniguti, Lucas M.","Pedro Vilanova","Kitajima, João P.","Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1748304e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1748304e3,"objectID":"8f8511fae7c66a9174d6e3ad533bceb6","permalink":"https://genomicslabesalq.github.io/publication/taniguti_2025/","publishdate":"2025-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/taniguti_2025/","section":"publication","summary":"In 2015, we published the complete genome assembly of             Sporisorium scitamineum             , the fungal pathogen responsible for sugarcane smut disease, generated from PacBio long-read sequencing and polished with Illumina short reads.

With climate change intensifying drought and expanding disease incidence, it is critical to understand how combined abiotic and biotic stresses influence plant defense. We investigated the transcriptomic response of a susceptible soybean cultivar to ASR infection under normal and water-limited conditions at four infection stages (12, 24, 72, and 192 hours after-inoculation). We observed a biphasic expression of defense-related genes, particularly resistance gene analogs (RGAs), with an early peak at 12 hours and a late resurgence at 192 hours. Combined stress induced a greater number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than rust alone, especially at early infection. Among the differentially expressed RGAs (RGADEs), over 64% belonged to the TM-LRR class, and NBS-LRR genes were the most enriched at known ASR resistance loci, particularly Rpp2.

One of these diseases, sugarcane smut, involves the emergence of a whip-like structure from the host apical shoot. The slow onset of this pathogenesis is the most substantial challenge for researchers to investigate the molecular events leading to resistance or susceptibility. In this study, we explored the early interaction between the smut fungus Sporisorium scitamineum and foliar tissues of the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Upon inoculation with the fungus, A. thaliana showed a compatible reaction, producing lesions during fungus colonization, whereas N. benthamiana showed signs of nonhost resistance. In addition, we propose a sugarcane detached leaf assay using plants cultivated in vitro to reveal sugarcane smut response outcomes. We used two sugarcane genotypes with known contrasting reactions to smut in the field. Although there is no evidence of sugarcane smut fungus infecting host leaves naturally, the sugarcane detached leaf assay enabled a rapid assessment of disease outcomes. Different symptoms in the detached leaves after inoculation distinguished smut-susceptible and smut-resistant sugarcane genotypes. Microscopic observations and gene expression analysis of S. scitamineum candidate effectors confirmed the fungal growth and its restriction on the compatible and incompatible interactions, respectively. These findings offer new prospects into the disease phenotyping of S. scitamineum, which could greatly expedite the comprehension of the initial stages of the pathogenesis and predict smut resistance in sugarcane genotypes.","tags":["article-journal"],"title":"Exploring Potential Surrogate Systems for Studying the Early Steps of the Sporisorium scitamineum Pathogenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Reis Soares, Nina","Costa, Zirlane Portugal","Marques, João Paulo Rodrigues","Garsmeur, Olivier","Sampaio Carneiro, Monalisa","Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello","D'Hont, Angélique","Vieira, Maria Lucia Carneiro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":17172e5,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":17172e5,"objectID":"eb972e6fea5717600d10e9d728755f48","permalink":"https://genomicslabesalq.github.io/publication/reis_soares_2024/","publishdate":"2024-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reis_soares_2024/","section":"publication","summary":"SUMMARY                            The sugarcane (               Saccharum               spp.) genome is one of the most complex of all. Modern varieties are highly polyploid and aneuploid as a result of hybridization between               Saccharum officinarum               and               S. spontaneum               . Little research has been done on meiotic control in polyploid species, with the exception of the wheat               Ph1               locus harboring the               ZIP4               gene (               TaZIP4               ‐B2) which promotes pairing between homologous chromosomes while suppressing crossover between homeologs. In sugarcane, despite its interspecific origin, bivalent association is favored, and multivalents, if any, are resolved at the end of prophase I. Thus, our aim herein was to investigate the purported genetic control of meiosis in the parental species and in sugarcane itself. We investigated the               ZIP4               gene and immunolocalized meiotic proteins, namely synaptonemal complex proteins Zyp1 and Asy1. The sugarcane               ZIP4               gene is located on chromosome 2 and expressed more abundantly in flowers, a similar profile to that found for               TaZIP4               ‐B2.               ZIP4               expression is higher in               S. spontaneum               a neoautopolyploid, with lower expression in               S. officinarum               , a stable octoploid species. The sugarcane Zip4 protein contains a TPR domain, essential for scaffolding. Its 3D structure was also predicted, and it was found to be very similar to that of               TaZIP4               ‐B2, reflecting their functional relatedness. Immunolocalization of the Asy1 and Zyp1 proteins revealed that               S. officinarum               completes synapsis. However, in               S. spontaneum               and SP80‐3280 (a modern variety), no nuclei with complete synapsis were observed. Importantly, our results have implications for sugarcane cytogenetics, genetic mapping, and genomics.                        ,              Significance Statement                            Our work provides insights into the genetic control of meiosis in sugarcane (               Saccharum               spp.), a man made polyploid and fertile plant of interspecific constitution. Inspired by the discoveries of the Ph1 locus, which harbors the ZIP4 gene in wheat, we identified this meiotic gene in both parental species and in two current sugarcane varieties. We analyzed both gene and protein sequence conservation, protein domains, and predicted the 3D‐protein structure. We also investigated the level of ZIP4 expression in different sugarcane tissues. Like its role in wheat, ZIP4 seems to promote pairing between homologous chromosomes while suppressing crossover between homeologs in               Saccharum.               Using immunocytology, we were able to determine synaptonemal complex polymerization during prophase I, using Asy1 and Zyp1 sugarcane specific antibodies, revealing synapsis defects in all genotypes except               Saccharum officinarum               , a parental species with regular meiotic behavior.","tags":["article-journal"],"title":"First investigation into the genetic control of meiosis in sugarcane","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prado, Guilherme Souza","Rocha, Dhiôvanna Corrêia","Santos, Lucas Nascimento Dos","Contiliani, Danyel Fernandes","Nobile, Paula Macedo","Martinati-Schenk, Juliana Camargo","Padilha, Lilian","Maluf, Mirian Perez","Lubini, Greice","Pereira, Tiago Campos","Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello","Creste, Silvana","Boscariol-Camargo, Raquel Luciana","Takita, Marco Aurélio","Cristofani-Yaly, Mariângela","Souza, Alessandra Alves De"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704672e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704672e3,"objectID":"9d2724f540a4388081526a0dd795651a","permalink":"https://genomicslabesalq.github.io/publication/prado_2024/","publishdate":"2024-01-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/prado_2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Gene editing technologies have opened up the possibility of manipulating the genome of any organism in a predicted way. CRISPR technology is the most used genome editing tool and, in agriculture, it has allowed the expansion of possibilities in plant biotechnology, such as gene knockout or knock-in, transcriptional regulation, epigenetic modification, base editing, RNA editing, prime editing, and nucleic acid probing or detection. This technology mostly depends on               in vitro               tissue culture and genetic transformation/transfection protocols, which sometimes become the major challenges for its application in different crops. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, biolistics, plasmid or RNP (ribonucleoprotein) transfection of protoplasts are some of the commonly used CRISPR delivery methods, but they depend on the genotype and target gene for efficient editing. The choice of the CRISPR system (Cas9, Cas12), CRISPR mechanism (plasmid or RNP) and transfection technique (Agrobacterium spp., PEG solution, lipofection) directly impacts the transformation efficiency and/or editing rate. Besides, CRISPR/Cas technology has made countries rethink regulatory frameworks concerning genetically modified organisms and flexibilize regulatory obstacles for edited plants. Here we present an overview of the state-of-the-art of CRISPR technology applied to three important crops worldwide (citrus, coffee and sugarcane), considering the biological, methodological, and regulatory aspects of its application. In addition, we provide perspectives on recently developed CRISPR tools and promising applications for each of these crops, thus highlighting the usefulness of gene editing to develop novel cultivars.","tags":["article-journal"],"title":"CRISPR technology towards genome editing of the perennial and semi-perennial crops citrus, coffee and sugarcane","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Castro-Moretti, Fernanda  R.","Gustavo Husein","Nunes, Jessica  D.K.","Lourenço, Silvia  A.","Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello","Amorim, Lilian","Mazzafera, Paulo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"e28d2867e2d1c578550ae86ccc87dffa","permalink":"https://genomicslabesalq.github.io/publication/castro-moretti_water_2024/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/castro-moretti_water_2024/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["article"],"title":"Water Limitation Causes Early-Stage Metabolic Perturbation in the Interaction of Soybean and the Causal Agent of Asian Soybean Rust","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bini, Andressa Peres","Serra, Marina Carnaz Duarte","Pastore, Izadora Farina","Brondi, Carolina Veluci","Camargo, Luis Eduardo Aranha","Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello","Van Sluys, Marie-Anne","Rossi, Guilherme Duarte","Creste, Silvana"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698796800,"objectID":"b5669e5684f9bcb01a49a367dd69a6cc","permalink":"https://genomicslabesalq.github.io/publication/bini_transmission_2023/","publishdate":"2023-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bini_transmission_2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Leaf scald is a destructive sugarcane disease caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas albilineans (Ashby) Dowson.

Six CEs were individually cloned into the pEDV6 vector and expressed by P. fluorescens EtHAn for translocation into the plant cells. Three CEs (g1052, g3890, and g5159) could suppress pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) responses with high reproducibility in different coinfiltration experiments with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000. In addition, three CEs (g1052, g4549, and g5159) were also found to be AvrB-induced suppressors of effector-triggered immunity (ETI), demonstrating for the first time that S. scitamineum can defeat both PTI and ETI responses. A transcriptomic analysis at different stages of infection by the smut fungus of three sugarcane cultivars with contrasting responses to the pathogen revealed that suppressors g1052, g3890, g4549, and g5159 were induced at the early stage of infection. By contrast, the two CEs (g2666 and g6610) that did not exhibit suppression activities expressed only at the late stage of infection. Moreover, genomic structures of the CEs and searches for orthologs in other smut species suggested duplication events and further divergence in CEs evolution of S. scitamineum.

Most of the genome sequences could be integrated into its chromosomes with cytogenomic markers (satellite DNA) as references. The repeated sequences accounted for 58.55% of the total DNA analyzed, and the               Tekay               lineage was the prevalent retrotransposon. In total, 25,327 coding genes were predicted.               Passiflora organensis               retains 5,609 singletons and 15,671 gene families. We focused on the genes potentially involved in the locus determining self‐incompatibility and the MADS‐box gene family, allowing us to infer expansions and contractions within specific subfamilies. Finally, we recovered the organellar DNA. Structural rearrangements and two mitoviruses, besides relics of other mobile elements, were found in the chloroplast and mt‐DNA molecules, respectively. This study presents the first draft genome assembly of a wild               Passiflora               species, providing a valuable sequence resource for genomic and evolutionary studies on the genus, and support for breeding cropped passionfruit species.                        ,              Core Ideas                                                                                     Passiflora organensis                     has a small genome of 259 Mbp.                                                                                             We estimate that the repetitive content of the                     P. organensis                     genome is approximately 59%.

Puccinia psidii               ), the causal agent of myrtle rust. We performed a phylogenomic analysis including the complete mitochondrial sequences from other rust fungi. The genome composed of 93.299 bp has 73 predicted genes, 33 of which encoded nonconserved proteins (ncORFs), representing almost 45% of all predicted genes.               A               .               psidii               mtDNA is one of the largest rust mtDNA sequenced to date, most likely due to the abundance of ncORFs.

Mobile genetic elements invading intron sequences may have played significant roles in size but not shaping of the rust mitochondrial genome structure. The mtDNAs from rust fungi are highly syntenic.

The expression profile of different genes after infection in contrasting sugarcane genotypes assessed by RT-qPCR depended on the plant genotypes and disease progression. Three candidate effector genes expressed earlier only in resistant plants, four expressed in both genotypes, and three later in susceptible plants. Ten genes were cloned and transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves to determine their subcellular location, while four localized in more than one compartment. Two candidates, g3890 having a nucleoplasmic and mitochondrial location and g5159 targeting the plant cell wall, were selected to obtain their possible corresponding host targets using co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiments and mass spectrometry. Various potential interactors were identified, including subunits of the protein phosphatase 2A and an endochitinase. We investigated the presence of orthologs in sugarcane and using transcriptome data present their expression profiles. Orthologs of sugarcane shared around 70% similarity.

It has been used as an animal model for studying different scientific questions ranging from the restoration of degraded green areas to medical aspects of Chagas disease, leishmaniasis and resistance against snake venom. As a marsupial,                 D. albiventris                 can also contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the different stages of organogenesis. Opossum joeys are born after only 13 days, and the final stages of organogenesis occur when the neonates are inside the pouch, depending on lactation. As neither the genome of this opossum species nor its transcriptome has been completely sequenced, the use of                 D. albiventris                 as an animal model is limited.

The de novo assembly of these transcripts generated 85,338 transcripts. Approximately 30% of these transcripts could be mapped against the amino acid sequences of                 M. domestica                 , the evolutionarily closest relative of                 D. albiventris                 to be sequenced thus far. Among the expressed transcripts, 2077 were found to be DE between P0 and P5, 13,780 between P0 and P10, and 1453 between P5 and P10.

Many have been the attempts to establish relationships between the genomic content of Resistance Gene Analogs (RGAs) of modern sugarcane cultivars to its degrees of resistance to diseases such as smut. However, due to the highly polyploid and heterozygous nature of sugarcane genome, large scale RGA predictions is challenging.                                         Results                                We predicted, searched for orthologs, and investigated the genomic features of RGAs within a recently released sugarcane elite cultivar genome, alongside the genomes of sorghum, one sugarcane ancestor (                 Saccharum spontaneum                 ), and a collection of de novo transcripts generated for six modern cultivars. In addition, transcriptomes from two sugarcane genotypes were obtained to investigate the roles of RGAs differentially expressed (RGADE) in their distinct degrees of resistance to smut. Sugarcane references lack RGAs from the TNL class (Toll-Interleukin receptor (TIR) domain associated to nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains) and harbor elevated content of membrane-associated RGAs. Up to 39% of RGAs were organized in clusters, and 40% of those clusters shared synteny. Basically, 79% of predicted NBS-encoding genes are located in a few chromosomes.                 S. spontaneum                 chromosome 5 harbors most RGADE orthologs responsive to smut in modern sugarcane. Resistant sugarcane had an increased number of RGAs differentially expressed from both classes of RLK (receptor-like kinase) and RLP (receptor-like protein) as compared to the smut-susceptible. Tandem duplications have largely contributed to the expansion of both RGA clusters and the predicted clades of RGADEs.                                                        Conclusions                                Most of smut-responsive RGAs in modern sugarcane were potentially originated in chromosome 5 of the ancestral                 S. spontaneum                 genotype. Smut resistant and susceptible genotypes of sugarcane have a distinct pattern of RGADE. TM-LRR (transmembrane domains followed by LRR) family was the most responsive to the early moment of pathogen infection in the resistant genotype, suggesting the relevance of an innate immune system. This work can help to outline strategies for further understanding of allele and paralog expression of RGAs in sugarcane, and the results should help to develop a more applied procedure for the selection of resistant plants in sugarcane.","tags":["article-journal"],"title":"Genome survey of resistance gene analogs in sugarcane: genomic features and differential expression of the innate immune system from a smut-resistant genotype","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bedre, Renesh","Irigoyen, Sonia","Schaker, Patricia D.

Genome-wide studies of AS in sugarcane (               Saccharum               spp.) are lacking, mainly due to the absence of a high-quality sequenced reference genome, sugarcane’s large, complex genome, and the variable chromosome numbers and polyploidy of sugarcane cultivars. Here, we analyzed changes in the sugarcane isoform-level transcriptome and AS landscape during infection with the smut fungus (               Sporisorium scitamineum               ) using a hybrid approach involving               Sorghum bicolor               reference-based and Trinity               de novo               mapping tools. In total, this analysis detected 16,039 and 15,379 transcripts (≥2 FPKM) at 5 and 200 days after infection, respectively. A conservative estimate of isoform-level expression suggested that approximately 5,000 (14%) sugarcane genes undergo AS. Differential expression analysis of the alternatively spliced genes in healthy and smut-infected sugarcane revealed 896 AS events modulated at different stages of infection. Gene family and gene ontology functional enrichment analysis of the differentially spliced genes revealed overrepresentation of functional categories related to the cell wall, defense, and redox homeostasis pathways. Our study provides novel insight into the AS landscape of sugarcane during smut disease interactions.","tags":["article-journal"],"title":"Genome-wide alternative splicing landscapes modulated by biotrophic sugarcane smut pathogen","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello","Peres Bini, A.","Serra, M.

The transcriptome and proteome of young plants of a susceptible cultivar with no symptoms of stunting but with relative low and high bacterial titers were compared at 30 and 60 days after inoculation. Increased bacterial titers were associated with alterations in the expression of 267 cDNAs and in the abundance of 150 proteins involved in plant growth, hormone metabolism, signal transduction and defense responses. Some alterations are predicted to benefit the pathogen, such as the up-regulation of genes involved in the synthesis of methionine. Also, genes and proteins of the cell division cycle were all down-regulated in plants with higher titers at both times. It is hypothesized that the negative effects on cell division related to increased bacterial titers is cumulative over time and its modulation by other host and environmental factors results in the stunting symptom.","tags":["article-journal"],"title":"Novel Insights Into the Early Stages of Ratoon Stunting Disease of Sugarcane Inferred from Transcript and Protein Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vieira, Maria Lucia C.","Almeida, Carmelice B.","Oliveira, Carlos A.","Tacuatiá, Luana O.","Munhoz, Carla F.","Cauz-Santos, Luiz A.","Pinto, Luciana R.","Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello","Xavier, Mauro A.","Forni-Martins, Eliana R."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528934400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528934400,"objectID":"641ecd2ce487344eaf641a27ce7e753e","permalink":"https://genomicslabesalq.github.io/publication/vieira_2018/","publishdate":"2018-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vieira_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["article-journal"],"title":"Revisiting Meiosis in Sugarcane: Chromosomal Irregularities and the Prevalence of Bivalent Configurations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benevenuto, Juliana","Teixeira-Silva, Natalia S.","Kuramae, Eiko E.","Croll, Daniel","Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522972800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522972800,"objectID":"49b4014d852188b3a1e4113a418304b7","permalink":"https://genomicslabesalq.github.io/publication/benevenuto_comparative_2018/","publishdate":"2018-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/benevenuto_comparative_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["article-journal"],"title":"Comparative Genomics of Smut Pathogens: Insights From Orphans and Positively Selected Genes Into Host Specialization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello","Carvalho Schaker, Patricia Dayane","Benevenuto, Juliana","Teixeira E Silva, Natália De Sousa","De Almeida, Sintia Silva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1520208e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520208e3,"objectID":"961418aff37ea3832ac5977c2b733332","permalink":"https://genomicslabesalq.github.io/publication/university_2018/","publishdate":"2018-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/university_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["book"],"title":"Progress in understanding fungal diseases affecting sugarcane: smut","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Schaker, Patricia D.

The fungus establishes a biotrophic interaction with sugarcane tissues, and unlike smut fungi of other monocot hosts, the primary meristem of sugarcane plants develops a whip‐like structure instead of a tumour‐like galls emerging from floral structures (tassels and ears). We examined  (GFP)‐tagged               S. scitamineum               infecting tissues of three sugarcane genotypes with distinct responses to smut (susceptible, intermediate resistant and resistant). Mating compatible haploid cells               gfp               ‐expressing  were obtained by               Agrobacterium tumefaciens               ‐mediated transformation (ATMT) using the integrative vector pFAT‐gfp. Regardless of the inoculation method  (drop inoculation and hypodermal syringe inoculation), all genotypes were colonised by the fungus. GFP‐tagged strains of opposite mating reaction were able to: (a) grow               in vitro               as fluorescent yeast‐like cells; (b) generate infectious dikaryon; (c) penetrate sugarcane tissues; (d) colonise tissues by growing a filamentous network; and (e) form the characteristic highly branched hyphae within host cells. Fungal colonisation 160 DAI revealed an association of the fungus with vascular vessels disrupting their organisation in all three genotypes analysed. However, the resistant plants did not develop whips spanning the experiment time. The first whips emerged 76 DAI from plants of the susceptible genotype whereas for intermediate resistant plants whips were detected at 137 DAI. These whips were dissected and fluorescent sporogenesis and teliospore maturation were analysed.               In vitro               germination of recovered teliospores revealed after meiosis the formation of a three‐celled hyphal filament, where the fourth cell was likely maintained in the teliospore coat. These cells showed independent segregation of the               gfp               marker, as a result of               gfp               insertions in different chromosomes of each compatible haploid strain. This work presents the complete fungal life cycle of GFP‐marked               S. scitamineum               to study developmental stages               in planta               .","tags":["article-journal"],"title":"Sporisorium scitamineum colonisation of sugarcane genotypes susceptible and resistant to smut revealed by GFP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Schaker, Patricia D.

Because knowledge on the interaction of Lxx with its host at the microscopic level is limited, the development of tools to monitor Lxx during the colonization process could shed new light on the processes that control disease development. In this investigation, a transformation protocol was optimized and a mutant Lxx strain engineered that stably expressed the               gfp               gene in sugarcane tissues.               In vitro               , the growth of the mutant did not differ from that of the wild type. Also, plants inoculated with both strains showed comparable growth and development when analysed 180 days after inoculation (dai). Fluorescence microscopy of roots, stalks, meristems and leaf tissues of Lxx‐               GFP               ‐inoculated plants was performed at 180 dai. In the leaves, Lxx‐tagged cells were observed within the xylem vessels as has been described before but, in addition, they were found in a new niche within the host tissues, in the mesophyll and in the bundle sheath cells surrounding the vascular system. This finding indicates that Lxx is able to move from the xylem to the parenchyma of the leaf cells. This first report of an Lxx mutant expressing a heterologous gene revealed that colonization of sugarcane by this pathogen is not limited to the xylem vessels as commonly reported.","tags":["article-journal"],"title":"A stable Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli GFP tagged strain reveals a new colonization niche in sugarcane tissues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Munhoz, C.F.","Santos, A.A.","Arenhart, R.A.","Santini, L.","Claudia Barros Monteiro-Vitorello","Vieira, M.L.C."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435708800,"objectID":"27687db94094050fb09ad04ca67d1ea1","permalink":"https://genomicslabesalq.github.io/publication/munhoz_2015/","publishdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/munhoz_2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Passiflora edulis               is the major species of passionflowers grown worldwide, mainly for juice production and fresh fruit, in climates ranging from cool subtropical (purple variety) to warm tropical (yellow variety). The bacterial leaf spot, caused by               Xanthomonas axonopodis               pv.               passiflorae               (               Xap               ) can be a serious disease affecting passion fruit production in commercial orchards, particularly under moist field conditions. In this study we describe a first analysis of host gene expression in this pathosystem. We used suppression subtractive hybridization to construct two               cDNA               libraries enriched for transcripts induced and repressed by               Xap               , respectively, 24 h post inoculation with a highly virulent strain. High‐quality sequences were obtained resulting in 998 unisequences that were used for annotation. In accordance with               BLASTX               results performed by               Blast2GO               tool, 86.7% of the unisequences showed similarity to other plant species' proteins related to different functional categories. Sixty‐three transcripts were similar to               Arabidopsis thaliana               defence‐related proteins identified in the               PLAZA               platform.               In silico               predicted protein–protein interactions were detected on the basis of the               STRING               database for 35 of the 63 defence‐related proteins. At this early stage of interaction, a set of genes was selected from               Blast2GO               categorization results and analysed by quantitative PCR (               qPCR               ). The expression profiles changed in response to the pathogen for 76% of these genes (48/63) and the differences in expression ratios ranged from 0.51‐fold to 1.83‐fold. In later stages of interactions (5 and 9 days post inoculation) when disease‐associated symptoms were visible,               qPCR               analyses were performed for 14 genes selected from both libraries. The expression profiles of all genes were found to be changed by the pathogen. The gene that responded most strongly to the pathogen attack encodes a lipoxygenase 2. In inoculated plants, its expression was induced 500‐fold and 300‐fold, 5 and 9 dpi, respectively, compared to controls, suggesting an important role of this gene in passion fruit defence. Moreover, we showed that most of the genes involved in well‐known pathogen recognition signalling pathways were repressed by               Xap               and this lends support to the idea that the jasmonic acid signalling pathway fails to be activated during the first hours of interaction.","tags":["article-journal"],"title":"Analysis of plant gene expression during passion fruit Xanthomonas axonopodis interaction implicates lipoxygenase 2 in host defence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Taniguti, Lucas M.","Schaker, Patricia D.
