      <description>&lt;p&gt;I began my scientific career at CEBTEC/ESALQ, where I carried out undergraduate research and a master’s degree in molecular biology, studying hormonal peptides related to plant development. In 2015, I moved to Belgium for my PhD, focusing on plant specialized metabolites. Shortly after, I pursued a postdoctoral fellowship in the area of plant-microbe interactions. All these experiences provided me with significant personal and professional growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned to Brazil at the end of 2023 with the goal of studying plant diseases and further developing my skills in bioinformatics. In 2024, I started a postdoctoral position in Professor Claudia’s lab, investigating sugarcane smut disease. In 2025, I was awarded a CNPq fellowship as a collaborating researcher, which allows me to integrate metabolomic analyses of smut disease development with structural studies of pathogen effectors.&lt;/p&gt;
