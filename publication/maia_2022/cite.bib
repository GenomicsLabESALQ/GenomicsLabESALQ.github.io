	abstract = {The facultative biotrophic basidiomycete Sporisorium scitamineum causes smut disease in sugarcane. This study applied an assay to identify S. scitamineum candidate effectors (CEs) with plant immunity suppression activities by delivering them into Nicotiana benthamiana cells via the type-three secretion system of Pseudomonas fluorescens EtHAn. Six CEs were individually cloned into the pEDV6 vector and expressed by P. fluorescens EtHAn for translocation into the plant cells. Three CEs (g1052, g3890, and g5159) could suppress pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) responses with high reproducibility in different coinfiltration experiments with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000. In addition, three CEs (g1052, g4549, and g5159) were also found to be AvrB-induced suppressors of effector-triggered immunity (ETI), demonstrating for the first time that S. scitamineum can defeat both PTI and ETI responses. A transcriptomic analysis at different stages of infection by the smut fungus of three sugarcane cultivars with contrasting responses to the pathogen revealed that suppressors g1052, g3890, g4549, and g5159 were induced at the early stage of infection. By contrast, the two CEs (g2666 and g6610) that did not exhibit suppression activities expressed only at the late stage of infection. Moreover, genomic structures of the CEs and searches for orthologs in other smut species suggested duplication events and further divergence in CEs evolution of S. scitamineum. Thus, the transient assay applied here demonstrated the potential of pEDV6 and P. fluorescens EtHAn as biological tools for identifying plant immune suppressors from S. scitamineum.},
