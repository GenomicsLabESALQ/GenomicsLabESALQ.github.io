	abstract = {Despite its global importance as a primary source of table sugar and bioethanol, sugarcane faces a significant threat to its production due to diseases. One of these diseases, sugarcane smut, involves the emergence of a whip-like structure from the host apical shoot. The slow onset of this pathogenesis is the most substantial challenge for researchers to investigate the molecular events leading to resistance or susceptibility. In this study, we explored the early interaction between the smut fungus Sporisorium scitamineum and foliar tissues of the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Upon inoculation with the fungus, A. thaliana showed a compatible reaction, producing lesions during fungus colonization, whereas N. benthamiana showed signs of nonhost resistance. In addition, we propose a sugarcane detached leaf assay using plants cultivated in vitro to reveal sugarcane smut response outcomes. We used two sugarcane genotypes with known contrasting reactions to smut in the field. Although there is no evidence of sugarcane smut fungus infecting host leaves naturally, the sugarcane detached leaf assay enabled a rapid assessment of disease outcomes. Different symptoms in the detached leaves after inoculation distinguished smut-susceptible and smut-resistant sugarcane genotypes. Microscopic observations and gene expression analysis of S. scitamineum candidate effectors confirmed the fungal growth and its restriction on the compatible and incompatible interactions, respectively. These findings offer new prospects into the disease phenotyping of S. scitamineum, which could greatly expedite the comprehension of the initial stages of the pathogenesis and predict smut resistance in sugarcane genotypes.},
