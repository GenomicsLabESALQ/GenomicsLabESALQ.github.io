	abstract = {Sporisorium scitamineum is a biotrophic fungus causing sugarcane smut disease. In this study, we set up a pipeline and used genomic and dual transcriptomic data previously obtained by our group to identify candidate effectors of S. scitamineum and their expression profiles in infected smut-resistant and susceptible sugarcane plants. The expression profile of different genes after infection in contrasting sugarcane genotypes assessed by RT-qPCR depended on the plant genotypes and disease progression. Three candidate effector genes expressed earlier only in resistant plants, four expressed in both genotypes, and three later in susceptible plants. Ten genes were cloned and transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves to determine their subcellular location, while four localized in more than one compartment. Two candidates, g3890 having a nucleoplasmic and mitochondrial location and g5159 targeting the plant cell wall, were selected to obtain their possible corresponding host targets using co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiments and mass spectrometry. Various potential interactors were identified, including subunits of the protein phosphatase 2A and an endochitinase. We investigated the presence of orthologs in sugarcane and using transcriptome data present their expression profiles. Orthologs of sugarcane shared around 70\% similarity. Identifying a set of putative fungal effectors and their plant targets provides a valuable resource for functional characterization of the molecular events leading to smut resistance in sugarcane plants and uncovers further opportunities for investigation.},
