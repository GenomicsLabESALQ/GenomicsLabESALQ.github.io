	abstract = {We assembled a dual-layered biological network to study the roles of resistance gene analogs (RGAs) in the resistance of sugarcane to infection by the biotrophic fungus causing smut disease. Based on sugarcane-
              Arabidopsis
              orthology, the modeling used metabolic and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              (from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and BioGRID databases) and plant resistance curated knowledge for Viridiplantae obtained through text mining of the UniProt/SwissProt database. With the network, we integrated functional annotations and transcriptome data from two sugarcane genotypes that differ significantly in resistance to smut and applied a series of analyses to compare the transcriptomes and understand both signal perception and transduction in plant resistance. We show that the smut-resistant sugarcane has a larger arsenal of RGAs encompassing transcriptionally modulated subnetworks with other resistance elements, reaching
              hub
              proteins of primary metabolism. This approach may benefit molecular breeders in search of markers associated with quantitative resistance to diseases in non-model systems.},
